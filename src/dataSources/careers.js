      \nThe software was based in the Steem blockchain and used its mechanism to generate tokens that were then redirected to open source contributors that applied for a reward in the platform. During its existence, it generated over $1.5 million that beneficiated thousands of developers, designers, and translators all over the world.
      \nI worked in the development of the Utopian v2 platform using vue.js with the Quasar framework; Node.JS and MongoDB in the backend, integrating with the Steem blockchain as well with other decentralized technologies such as IPFS.
